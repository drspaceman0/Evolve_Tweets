# Evolve_Tweets
A genetic algorithm that generates tweets.

Homework for my Evolutionary Computation class. This is my first attempt at creating a twitter bot that uses genetic algorithms 
to generate tweets.

Fitness was determined by if a tweet had good grammar (things like no two articles next to eachother, has a subject, etc), and whether 
it had "likes" on twitter. So tweets with likes would produce offspring in the next generation.

This project turned out poorly. All the tweets turned out jumbled, and incomprehensible. Still cool though. 

To run this program, you will need Tweepy by joshthecoder to put tweets online. https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy 
Thanks Josh for the program
